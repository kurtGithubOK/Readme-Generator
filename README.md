## The deployed app is here:  https://kurtgithubok.github.io/Coding-Quiz/

## It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Implementation Notes:
* The main part of the UI consists of a number of div tags wrapping each component of the UI.
* Those divs are stored in an array to control changing of the views.


## Remembering to do clearTimeout() and clearInterval() - was the cause of an odd bug that I had to fix.
